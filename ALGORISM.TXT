The Fisher-Yates algorithm, also known as the Knuth shuffle, 
is an algorithm used to randomly shuffle the elements of an array.
It ensures that each possible permutation of the elements is equally likely,
resulting in an unbiased and fair shuffling.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Fisher-Yates algorithm:

1. Start with an array of elements.
2. Iterate through the array from the last element to the first element 
(index `i` decreasing from `array.length - 1` to `1`).

3. For each iteration, generate a random index `j` between `0` and `i` (inclusive). 
This index represents the position of an element that has not been shuffled yet.

4. Swap the element at index `i` with the element at index `j` using a temporary variable 
or using destructuring assignment in modern JavaScript (`[array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]]`).

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for each iteration until you reach the first element (index `0`).

The algorithm works by gradually building the shuffled portion of the array from the end towards the beginning. 
At each iteration, it selects a random unshuffled element and swaps it with the element at the current position,
 ensuring that each element has an equal chance of ending up in any position.

By the time the algorithm completes all iterations, the entire array will be shuffled, and each possible permutation of the elements
 will have an equal probability of occurring.

The Fisher-Yates algorithm is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
 It is a widely used and reliable method for shufflingÂ arrays.
